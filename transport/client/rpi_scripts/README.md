# Scripts for reading sensors in a Raspberry Pi Zero W

This folder contains two folders for reading the output of two types of different sensors wired to a Rasperry Pi Zero W.

* The folder `package_alarm` includes the required script for reading a "light sensor"
* The folder `temperature_and_humidity` includes the required script for reading a `DHT22` temperature and humidity sensor

For using any of these scripts copy all the contents of the desired folder into the Raspberry Pi and run `npm i` after npm is done you can call the script to read the sensor values.
