# Workshop: Knowledge Sharing on Custom Transactions

This workshop will guide you through learning about custom transactions with a step-by-step approach.
The workshop demands you actively participate in order to get familiar with custom transactions.

## Setup
1. Clone [Lisk-SDK-Examples](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples) repository locally and checkout branch `workshop-custom-txs-start`.

2. Navigate inside `/workshop` folder and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

3. In order to verify the setup is correct, try to run the application with `npm start`. The `npm start` command will run the `index.js` file and pipe the outputted logs to our preferred log formatter Bunyan. If everything is running fine, you can go to the next section.
